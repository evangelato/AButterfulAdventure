# A Butterful Adventure

This is a Demo of A Butterful Adventure, a 2D platforming game with a butter as a main protagonist. With dreams of making it to the best dish in the city, our protagonist instead finds himself in the sewers. The protagonist must navigate through danger to make his way to the top of the hotel where a revolving restaurant awaits him. To do so, the player needs to strike a delicate balance between speed and health as the butter melts himself to increase his speed.



At the moment there are only three levels completed but more is on the way.
